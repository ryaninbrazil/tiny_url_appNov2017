Tiny-App
This is the project for the second week of Lighthouse Labs

Project Description

This three-day project will have you building a tiny (pun intended) web app using Node. The app will allow users to shorten long URLs much like TinyURL.com, bit.ly, and the like.

Unlike last project where you build an HTTP Client which makes requests to the GitHub server, this one will have you building the HTTP Server to handle requests from the browser (client).

You'll get introduced to some more advanced JavaScript and node concepts and also learn more about Express, a mini web framework which is extremely popular in the node community.

By the end of the week you will hopefully also have deployed it the "Cloud" so that anyone can use it.

Functional Requirements

As an avid twitter poster,
I want to be able to shorten links
so that I can fit more non-link text in my tweets.

When I visit http://localhost:/8080/url/
Then I see a form which contains a field to submit a URL and a button

When I fill in the form with a URL and submit it
Then I see a page with the original URL, a short URL and link to go back to the submission form

As an avid twitter poster,
I want to be able to see how many times my subscribers visit my links
so that I can learn what content they like.

When I visit http://localhost:8080/url/
Then I see a login form

When I submit the login form Then I am logged in

Given I submitted links when I was logged in When I visit /urls Then I see my links and the number of visits each had

As a twitter reader,
I want to be able to visit sites via shortened links,
so that I can read interesting content.

When I visit a short link
Then I am redirected to the page corresponding to the short URL's original URL
